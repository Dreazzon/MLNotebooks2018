A repository for the exercises to the Machine Learning course at Aarhus University. 
Credit to Alexander Mathiasen who created many of these exercises last year (https://github.com/AlexanderMath). We made a few adjustments this year and added exercises on dimensionality reduction inspired by Allans exercises from last year.
